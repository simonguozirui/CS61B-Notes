This is my collection of notes I took during lecture for [CS61B Data Structures](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20/) by [Prof. Paul Hilfinger](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hilfingr/) at UC Berkeley in Spring 2020.

If you like my notes, would really appreciate if you :star: this repo and follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/simonguozirui)!
