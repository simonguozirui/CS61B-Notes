Python dynamically typed: the information of the type of variable is carried in the data
Java static typed: 

`/** */` documentation comments

In Java, everything is in some class

Classes are then gathered into packages

`public` outside, clients
Exported interface

Static methods and variables are "one-of" things
Contained in the text rather than in runtime data
